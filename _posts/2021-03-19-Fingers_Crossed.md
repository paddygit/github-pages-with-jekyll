Learning has always been a human pursuit and I being a human am no different. I love to learn. I listen to a lot of audio books, watch many tutorials on varied subjects and read through anything I feel will make me better at a subject.

Starting the blog with GitHub in the pursuit of exploring how it is done in Github is a very pleasant occurrence. 

GitHub is filled with knowledge. I could not look for a better place to start than lab.github.com as it covers anything you could be looking out for from Github.

Keeping fingers crossed on continuing this wonderful exploration and sharing of my learning I sign off this post.
