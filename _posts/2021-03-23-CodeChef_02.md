Getting back from work and getting on with Codechef is not so entertaining. Mind does deviate towards Youtube :). But hey, commitment right? right!

Starting the challenge felt like going for a huge challenge but once a pseudo code was sketched on paper it was just too easy to code out. Thought process for a lot of factors are what mattered. 

Hope the code legible and any comments are always welcome. :)

Enormous Input Test
The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the enormous Input/Output warning. You are expected to be able to process at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.

Input
The input begins with two positive integers n k (n, k<=107). The next n lines of input contain one positive integer ti, not greater than 109, each.

Output
Write a single integer to output, denoting how many integers ti are divisible by k.

Example
Input:
7 3
1
51
966369
7
9
999996
11

Output:
4

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int sum = 0;
	int n = 0;
	int k = 0;
	int t = 0;
	int i = 0;
	cin >> n >> k;
	if(k > 10000000)
	{
	   cout << sum;
	   return 0;
	}
	else
	{
	    while(i < n)
	    {
	        i++;
	        cin >> t;
	        if (t > 1000000000)
	        {
	            continue;
	        }
	        else if(t < k)
	        {
	            continue;
	        }
	        else if (t == k)
	        {
	            sum +=1;
	            continue;
	        }
	        else
	        {
	            if(t % k == 0)
	            {
	                sum += 1;
	            }
	        }
	    }
	    cout << sum;
	}
	return 0;
}
```
